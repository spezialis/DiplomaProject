# Diploma project
This project is an attempt to create and establish a strong link between reality and Virtual Reality. In a way that reflect how to manipulate the reality and influence the virtual world and vice versa.

## TODO | DONE
### Unity
- [ ] Create 3 difference environment for each box.
- [x] Make the animation of the explosion.
- [ ] ~~Every time the user approach one cube a new environment is loaded.~~
- [x] ~~Attach the player to the VR camera.~~
- [ ] When the user put his hand inside a cube the world inside explode out
- [ ] Improve the scripts for the serial communication between Unity and Arduino.
- [ ] A lot of more stuff in the codes

#### Some visuals
- [ ] Create a storyboard for my virtual universe
